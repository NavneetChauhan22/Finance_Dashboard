Hello Everyone,

I created this Finance Dashboard in Tableau using the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their website.

**Problem Statement **
The goal of this Tableau Dashboard is to analyze the financial performance of a company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data. The aim is to create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

Sections in the Report The report consists of several sections where you can manage and view the data:

Data Slicing: The report data can be filtered by Segments, Country, and Year to display specific information.

Summary Cards: The dashboard includes cards that show Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale, and Total Profit.

Quarterly Profit Analysis: A clustered bar chart displays the profit quarterly, with the year on the X-Axis and profit on the Y-Axis.

Monthly Profit Analysis: An area chart illustrates monthly profits, with months on the X-Axis and profit on the Y-Axis.

Additionally, a Reset button is available at the top to clear all filters. To use it, hold CTRL and then click to reset all filters.
